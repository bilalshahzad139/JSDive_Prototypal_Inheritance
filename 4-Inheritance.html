        2) It will go to SeniorManager.prototype and see if it contains 'toString' function. It doesn't.
        Question: Where will it go next? What is type of SeniorManager.prototype now? => Manager
        3) It will go to Manager.prototype and see if it contains 'toString' function. It doesn't.
        Question: Where will it go next? What is type of Manager.prototype now? => Employee
        4) It will go to Employee.prototype and see if it contains 'toString' function. It doesn't.
        Question: Where will it go next? What is type of Employee.prototype now? => Object
        5) It will go to Object.prototype and see if it conatains 'toString' function. Yes it does.
